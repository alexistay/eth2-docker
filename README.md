# eth2-docker v0.1.1
Unofficial and experimental docker build instructions for eth2 clients

**Short-lived spadina branch**<br />
With defaults to run Prysm (and maybe Lighthouse) nodes on spadina.

This project builds clients from source. A similar workflow for
binary images is a TODO, as long as it does not duplicate work
by client teams.

Currently included clients:
- Lighthouse, with local geth
- Prysm, with local geth

# USAGE

## Before you start

Warnings about the dangers of running eth2 validators are in [RECOMMENDATIONS.md](RECOMMENDATIONS.md).
That file also contains a link to SomerEsat's [guide on host security](https://medium.com/@SomerEsat/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-medalla-nimbus-5f4b2b0f2d7c), and comments on key security.
Please take a look.

## Steps to bring an eth2 node up

- Install [prerequisites](PREREQUISITES.md)
- [Choose a client](SETUP.md) and do initial setup. This is a required step.
- Build the client
- Generate deposit files and an eth2 wallet. This can be done within this project, or outside of it
- Import the validator keystore files generated in the previous step
- Run the client
- Optional: Wait until the eth1 node and beacon node are fully synchronized
- Finalize the deposit. This is not done within this project

## Build the client

Build all required images from source. This will take 20-30 minutes.<br />
`sudo docker-compose build`

## Create an eth2 wallet and validator keystore and deposit files

You will deposit eth to the deposit contract, and receive locked eth2 in turn.<br />
[RECOMMENDATIONS.md](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) has comments on key security.

Edit the `.env` file to set the number of validators you wish to run. The default
is just one (1) validator.

This command will get you ready to deposit eth:<br />
`sudo docker-compose run deposit-cli`

The created files will be in the directory `.eth2/validator_keys` in this project.
This is also where you'd place your own keystore files if you already have some for import.

### You brought your own keys

They go into `.eth2/validator_keys` in this project directory, not directly under `$HOME`.

## Create a validator wallet by importing validator keys

**Warning** Import your validator key(s) to only *one* client.

Import the validator key(s) to the validator client:

`sudo docker-compose run validator-import`

> #### Prysm-specific
> - You will be asked to provide a wallet directory. Use `/var/lib/prysm`.
> - You will be asked to provide a "New wallet password", independent of the
>   keystore password. 
> - If you choose not to store the wallet password with the validator,
>   you will need to edit `prysm-base.yml` and comment out the wallet-password-file
>   parameter

If you choose to save the password during import, it'll be available to the client every
time it starts. If you do not, you'll need to be present to start the
validator and start it interactively. Determine your own risk profile.

## Start the client

To start the client:
```
sudo docker-compose up -d eth2
```

If, however, you chose not to store the wallet password with the validator, you will need
to bring the beacon and, if in use, geth, up individually instead, then "run"
the validator so it can prompt you for input:

```
sudo docker-compose up -d geth beacon
sudo docker-compose run validator
```

After providing the wallet password, use the key sequence Ctrl-p Ctrl-q to detach
from the running container.

## Depositing

Once you are ready, you can send eth to the deposit contract by using
the `.eth2/validator_keys/deposit_data-TIMESTAMP.json` file at the [Medalla launchpad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/).

## Grafana Dashboards

I'll repeat /u/SomerEsat's instructions on how to set up Grafana. 
- Connect to http://YOURSERVERIP:3000/, log in as admin/admin, set a new password
- Click on the gear icon on the left, choose "Data Sources", and "Add Data Source". Choose Prometheus, use `http://prometheus:9090` as the URL, then click "Save and Test".
- Import a Dashboard. Click on the + icon on the left, choose "Import". Copy/paste JSON code from one of the client dashboard links below (click anywhere inside the page
the link gets you to, use Ctrl-a to select all and Ctrl-C to copy), click "Load", choose the "prometheus" data source you just configured, click "Import".
- For Teku, you can use the grafana.com URL instead of raw JSON.

## Autostart the client on boot

Docker Desktop for Windows 10 and MacOS may do this automatically, TBD.

For Linux systems that use systemd, e.g. Ubuntu, you'd create a systemd
service. 

- Copy the file: `sudo cp sample-systemd /etc/systemd/system/eth2.service`
- Edit the file `/etc/systemd/system/eth2.service`
- Adjust the `WorkingDirectory` to the directory you stored the project in.
- Adjust the path to `docker-compose` to be right for your system, see `which docker-compose`
- Test the service: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, `sudo systemctl start eth2`, check `docker ps` to
see all expected containers are up
- Enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable eth2`

## Monitor the client

Monitoring the logs of the client is useful for troubleshooting
and to judge the amount of time left before the beacon and geth nodes
are fully synchronized.

To see a list of running containers:

```
sudo docker ps
```

To see the logs of a container:

```
sudo docker logs -f CONTAINERNAME
```

or

```
sudo docker-compose logs -f SERVICENAME
```

## Update the software

This project does not monitor client versions. It is up to you to decide that you
are going to update a component. When you are ready to do so, the below instructions
show you how to.

### The project itself

Inside the project directory, run:<br />
`git pull`

Then `cp .env .env.bak` and `cp default.env .env`, and set variables inside `.env`
the way you need them, with `.env.bak` as a guide.

### Geth

Run:<br />
`sudo docker-compose build --no-cache geth`

Then stop, remove and start geth:<br />
`sudo docker-compose stop geth && sudo docker-compose rm geth`<br />
`sudo docker-compose up -d geth`

### Client

Beacon and validator share the same image, we only need to rebuild one.

Run:<br />
`sudo docker-compose build --no-cache beacon`

Then restart the client:<br />
`sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose up -d eth2`

If you did not store the wallet password with the validator, come up 
[more manually](#start-the-client) instead.

# Troubleshooting

A few useful commands if you run into issues. As always, `sudo` is a Linux-ism and not needed on Windows 10.

`sudo docker-compose stop servicename` brings a service down, for example `docker-compose stop validator`.<br />
`sudo docker-compose down` will stop the entire stack.<br />
`sudo docker-compose up -d servicename` starts a single service, for example `sudo docker-compose up -d validator`.
The `-d` means "detached", not connected to your input session.<br />
`sudo docker-compose run servicename` starts a single service and connects your input session to it. Use the Ctrl-p Ctrl-q
key sequence to detach from it again.

`sudo docker ps` lists all running services, with the container name to the right.<br />
`sudo docker logs containername` shows logs for a container, `sudo docker logs -f containername` scrolls them.<br />
`sudo docker-compose logs servicename` shows logs for a service, `sudo docker-compose logs -f servicename` scrolls them.<br />
`sudo docker exec -it containername /bin/bash` will connect you to a running service in a bash shell. The geth service doesn't have a shell.<br />

You may start a service with `sudo docker-compose up -d servicename` and then find it's not in `sudo docker ps`. That means it terminated while
trying to start. To investigate, you could leave the `-d` off so you see logs on command line:<br />
`sudo docker-compose up beacon`, for example.<br />
You could also run `sudo docker-compose logs beacon` to see the last logs of that service and the reason it terminated.<br />

If a service is not starting and you want to bring up its container manually, so you can investigate, first bring everything down:<br />
`sudo docker-compose down`, tear down everything first.<br />
`sudo docker ps`, make sure everything is down.<br />

**HERE BE DRAGONS** You can totally run N copies of an image manually and then successfully start a validator in each and get yourself slashed.
Take extreme care.

Once your stack is down, to run an image and get into a shell, without executing the client automatically:<br />
`sudo docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash imagename`, for example `sudo docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash lighthouse`.<br />
You'd then run Linux commands manually in there, you could start components of the client manually. There is one image per client,
the client images currently supplied are `lighthouse` and `prysm`.<br />
`sudo docker images` will show you all images.

# Guiding principles:

- Reduce the attack surface of the client where this is feasible. Not
  all clients lend themselves to be statically compiled and running
  in "scratch"
- Guide users to good key management as much as possible
- Create something that makes for a good user experience and guides people new to docker and Linux as much as feasible
