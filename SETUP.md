# Initial setup

If you haven't already, please see [prerequisites](PREREQUISITES.md) and meet them for your OS.
This file steps you through client choice as well as some basic host security steps on Linux.

## Non-root user on Linux

If you are logged in as root, create a non-root user with your `USERNAME` of choice to log in as,
and give it sudo rights. `sudo` allows you to run commands `as root` while logged in as a non-root
user. This may be needed on a VPS, and is not typically needed on a local fresh install of Ubuntu.

```
adduser USERNAME
```

You will be asked to create a password for the new user, among other things. Then, give the new user
administrative rights by adding it to the `sudo` group.

```
usermod -aG sudo USERNAME
```

Optional: If you used SSH keys to connect to your Ubuntu instance via the root user you
will need to associate the new user with the root userâ€™s SSH key data.

`rsync --archive --chown=USERNAME:USERNAME ~/.ssh /home/USERNAME`

Finally, log out of `root` and log in as your `USERNAME`.

## "Pull" the project

From a terminal - Powershell if you are installing the node on Windows - and logged in as the user
you'll be using from now on, and assuming you'll be storing the project in your `$HOME`, run:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/eth2-educators/eth2-docker.git
cd eth2-docker
```

## Client choice

Please choose:
- The eth2 client you wish to run
  - Lighthouse
  - Prysm
- Your source of eth1 data
  - geth
  - 3rd-party
- Whether to run a slasher (not yet implemented)
- Whether to run a grafana dashboard for monitoring (not yet implemented)

First, copy the environment file.<br />
`cp default.env .env`

Then, adjust the contents of `.env`. On Ubuntu Linux, you can run `nano .env`.
- Set the `GRAFFITI` string if you want a POAP or just a specific string
- If you are on Linux, adjust `LOCAL_UID` to the UID of the logged-in user. 
`echo $UID` will show it to you. It is highly recommended to run as a non-root
user on Linux. On [Debian](https://devconnected.com/how-to-add-a-user-to-sudoers-on-debian-10-buster/)
you may need to install `sudo` and add your user to the `sudoers` group. Ubuntu
has that functionality built-in.
- Set the `COMPOSE_FILE` entry depending on the client you are going to run,
and with which options. See below for available compose files.
- If you are going to use a 3rd-party provider as your eth1 chain source, set `ETH1_NODE` to that URL.
- Adjust ports if you are going to need custom ports instead of the defaults. These are the ports
exposed to the Internet via your firewall/router.

Note that the Prysm client will find its external IP, but this project currently assumes
that IP is static. You can restart the container, possibly via crontab, with
`docker-compose restart beacon` if your IP is dynamic.<br />
Work to support dynamic DNS would be welcome.

### Client compose files

Set the `COMPOSE_FILE` string depending on which client you are going to use. Add optional services like
geth with `:` between the file names.
- `lh-base.yml` - Lighthouse
- `prysm-base.yml` - Prysm
- `geth.yml` - local geth eth1 chain node
- `grafana.yml` - grafana dashboard

For example, Lighthouse with local geth and grafana:
`COMPOSE_FILE=lh-base.yml:geth.yml:grafana.yml`

## Firewalling

You'll want to forward ports to the services of your eth2 node, and on Linux, enable a host firewall.
These are the relevant ports, and commands to add them to `ufw` if you are on Ubuntu Linux.
Ports that I mention should be "Open to Internet" need to be either forwarded
to your node if behind a home router, or allowed in via the VPS firewall.

- 30303 tcp/udp - local eth1 node, geth or openethereum. Open to Internet.
- 9000 tcp/udp - lighthouse beacon node. Open to Internet.
- 13000/tcp - Prysm beacon node. Open to Internet.
- 12000/udp - Prysm beacon node. Open to Internet.
- 3000/tcp - Grafana. **Not** open to Internet, allow locally only. It is insecure http.
- 22/tcp - SSH. Only open to Internet if this is a remote server (VPS). If open to Internet, configure
  SSH key authentication.

On Ubuntu, the host firewall `ufw` can be used to only allow specific ports inbound.
- Document the ports you need, then allow them to come in. Some examples below.
  - `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH` will allow ssh inbound
  - `sudo ufw allow 30303` will allow traffic to port 30303, both tcp and udp.
  - `sudo ufw allow 13000/tcp` will allow traffic to port 13000, tcp only
- Enable the firewall and check the rules you created
  - `sudo ufw enable`
  - `sudo ufw status numbered`

## Time synchronization on Linux

The blockchain requires precise time-keeping. Configure [ntpd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)
to synchronize time on your Linux server.

For Ubuntu, first we switch off the built-in, less precise synchronization and verify it is off. You should see
`NTP service: inactive`.

```
sudo timedatectl set-ntp no
timedatectl
```

Then install the ntp package. It will start automatically. `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ntp`

Check that ntp is running correctly: Run `nptq -p` , you expect to see a number of ntp time servers with
IP addresses in their `refid`, and several servers with a refid of `.POOL.`

## SSH key authentication with Linux

This is for logging into your node server, assuming that node server runs Linux. You will start
on the machine you are logging in from, whether that is Windows 10, MacOS or Linux, and then
make changes to the server you are logging in to.

On Windows 10, you expect the [OpenSSH client](https://winaero.com/blog/enable-openssh-client-windows-10/)
to already be installed. If it isn't, follow that link and install it.

From your MacOS/Linux Terminal or Windows Powershell, check whether you have an ssh key. You expect an id_TYPE.pub
file when running `ls ~/.ssh`.

Create a key if you need to, or if you don't have `id_ed25519.pub` but prefer that cipher:<br />
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`

Output the contents of your public key file to terminal and copy, here for `id_ed25519.pub`:<br />
`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

On your Linux server, logged in as your non-root user, add this public key to your account:<br />
```
mkdir ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
And paste in the public key.

Test your login. `ssh user@serverIP` from your client's MacOS/Linux Terminal or Windows Powershell should log you in
directly without prompting for a password.<br />
If you are still prompted for a password, resolve that first. Your ssh client should show you errors in that case.
On Windows 10 in particular, if the ssh client complains about the "wrong permissions" on the `.ssh` directory or
`.ssh/config` file, go into Explorer, find the `C:\Users\USERNAME\.ssh` directory, edit its Properties->Security, click
Advanced, then make your user the owner with Full Access, while removing access rights to anyone else, such as SYSTEM
and Administrators. That should solve the issues the OpenSSH client had.

Lastly, once key authentication has been tested, turn off password authentication. On your Linux server:<br />
`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Find the line that reads `#PasswordAuthentication yes` and remove the comment character `#` and change it to `PasswordAuthentication no`.

And restart the ssh service, for Ubuntu you'd run `sudo systemctl restart ssh`.
